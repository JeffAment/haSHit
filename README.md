# haSHit
Command line tool to generate MD5 checksums for files, and verify their integrity later.  Great to check for corrupted files so that you can restore them from a backup before the corruption propogates to other backups.  This program has been tested working on both Mac and Linux based machines. Future functionality that I hope to implement can be found in the code in "//todo:" lines.

# How to use
This program uses OpenSSL and the Boost filesystem library.  Instructions for how to install these can be found in the Wiki tab of this repository.  Usage notes can be found by running the executable with no/invalid arguments, as well as in the Wiki.
